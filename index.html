                            Hi, I'm John-Michael. I used to say I was passionate about tech, but as
                            I learnt more and more about the world of technology, I realised that I
                            was spreading myself too thin. My interest in the cloud industry began
                            when my father asked me to safely store his photos, videos, and contacts.
                            I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and use. It sparked my desire
                            to help develop similar applications that enable people to safely keep
                            their precious memories and other important documents. I became interested
                            in AI, because it's the new hot thing! Despite its controversial nature,
                            it's genuinely fascinating seeing the rapid advancement of such cutting-edge
                            technology. Finally, my interest in cybersecurity stems not only from seeing
                            frequent reports of large-scale hacks in the news, but also from personal
                            experience — I was targeted once when I was younger. Since then, I’ve made
                            it a priority to read up on and follow basic security principles.
                        </p>

                            During my time at Computer City, I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting
                            and repairing a wide range of computer hardware and software issues. I
                            became proficient in diagnosing and fixing faulty components in both PCs
                            and laptops, including performing upgrades and repairs on motherboards,
                            hard drives, and RAM. One of my key achievements was successfully recovering
                            systems with broken BIOS and performing fresh installations of Windows
                            on machines that had completely failed. Additionally, I handled troubleshooting
                            of network - related issues, such as firewalls and VPN configurations,
                            helping customers resolve connectivity problems. This knowledge has remained 
			    valuable over the years, and I continue to apply it by repairing and restoring
                            old laptops as a personal hobby. Feel free to explore my Work page to see
                            examples of my hands-on experience.

                            During my time at university, I have become proficient in programming
                            languages such as Python, C, Java, and SQL, applying these skills in academic
                            projects, problem-solving, and algorithm optimization. I’ve built a strong
                            foundation in algorithms and data structures, utilizing sorting, searching,
                            graph traversal, and optimization techniques like dynamic programming and
                            backtracking to solve complex problems. My understanding of data structures
                            — such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees — has enabled
                            me to design efficient and scalable solutions. Networking is another area
                            where I’ve gained hands-on experience, including knowledge of protocols
                            like TCP/IP, VPNs, and firewalls. I've also learnt how to develop web applications
                            using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My familiarity with the Linux CLI and
                            Git has allowed me to work effectively in collaborative environments, streamlining
                            workflows and version control.

                            Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy activities that challenge both
                            my mind and creativity. I was an avid chess player and a member of a club
                            for 3 years. Currently my passion lies in tabletop role-playing games,
                            where exploring the creative and imaginative world crafted by my DM gives
                            me a thrill I had never quite experienced before. I particularly love the
                            storytelling and world-building aspects, although I'm no slouch in the
                            strategic and number crunching sides of the game. When I visit my parents,
                            I enjoy tending to their vegetable and flower garden with my father. It’s
                            a relaxing activity that gives us a chance to bond and catch up while enjoying
                            the outdoors.

                            A C program simulating a 2x2x4 Tower Cube puzzle, complete with algorithms
                            for solving. Using an innovative idea for representing the transformative
                            nature of the cube, this program can be coupled with a visualiser to make
                            one of the first proper Tower Cube Simulator on the internet.
