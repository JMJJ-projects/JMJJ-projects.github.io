                        <p class="info">Hi, I'm John-Michael. I used to say I was passionate about tech, but as I learnt more and more about the world of technology, I realised that I was spreading myself too thin. My interest in the cloud industry began when my father asked me to safely store his photos, videos, and contacts. I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and use. It sparked my desire to help develop similar applications that enables people to safely keep their precious memories and other important documents. I became interest in AI, because it's the new hot thing! Despite its controversial nature, it's genuinely fascinating seeing the rapid advancement of such cutting-edge technology. Finally, my interest in cybersecurity stems not only from seeing frequent reports of large-scale hacks in the news, but also from personal experience—I was targeted once when I was younger. Since then, I’ve made it a priority to read up on and follow basic security principles.
                        </p>
                        <p class="info">During my time at Computer City, I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting and repairing a wide range of computer hardware and software issues. I became proficient in diagnosing and fixing faulty components in both PCs and laptops, including performing upgrades and repairs on motherboards, hard drives, and RAM. One of my key achievements was successfully recovering systems with broken BIOS and performing fresh installations of Windows on machines that had completely failed. Additionally, I handled troubleshooting of network-related issues, such as firewalls and VPN configurations, helping customers resolve connectivity problems. This knowledge has stayed with me over the years, and I continue to apply it by repairing and restoring old laptops as a personal hobby. Feel free to explore my Work page to see examples of my hands-on experience.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="info">During my time at university, I have become proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, Java, and SQL, applying these skills in academic projects, problem-solving, and algorithm optimization. I’ve built a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures, utilizing sorting, searching, graph traversal, and optimization techniques like dynamic programming and backtracking to solve complex problems. My understanding of data structures—such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees—has enabled me to design efficient and scalable solutions. Networking is another area where I’ve gained hands-on experience, including knowledge of protocols like TCP/IP, VPNs, and firewalls. My familiarity with the Linux CLI and Git has allowed me to work effectively in collaborative environments, streamlining workflows and version control. Additionally, I’ve developed web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, further enhancing my ability to create interactive and user-friendly solutions.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="info">Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy activities that challenge both my mind and creativity. I was an avid chess player and a member of a club for 3 years. Currently my passion lies in tabletop role-playing games, where exploring the creative and imaginative world crafted by my DM gives me a thrill I had never quite experienced before. I particular love the storytelling and world building aspects, although I'm no slouch in the strategic and number crunching sides of the game. When I visit my parents, I enjoy tending to their vegetable and flower garden with my father. It’s a relaxing activity that gives us a chance to bond and catch up while enjoying the outdoors.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
